### High-Level DSA Roadmap for Beginner Programmers

#### Level 1: Must-Know Concepts

1. **Introduction to DSA**
   - Why study DSA?
   - Definition of data structures and algorithms
   - Importance of DSA in programming and problem-solving

2. **Basic Data Structures**
   - **Arrays**
     - Basic operations (insert, delete, search, update)
     - Common problems (finding duplicates, maximum subarray, rotation)
   - **Strings**
     - Basic operations (concatenation, substring, search)
     - String manipulation problems (anagrams, palindromes)
   - **Linked Lists**
     - Singly and doubly linked lists
     - Basic operations (insert, delete, reverse)
     - Common problems (detect cycle, merge two sorted lists)

3. **Introduction to Algorithms**
   - Definition and importance
   - Simple algorithms (linear search, binary search)
   - Introduction to sorting (bubble sort)

4. **Complexity Analysis**
   - Time complexity (Big O notation, best/average/worst case analysis)
   - Space complexity
   - Analyzing complexity of simple algorithms (linear search, bubble sort)

5. **Linear Data Structures**
   - **Stacks**
     - Stack operations (push, pop, peek)
     - Applications (balanced parentheses, next greater element)
   - **Queues**
     - Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, front)
     - Circular queue
     - Priority queues

6. **Recursion**
   - Basic recursion problems (factorial, Fibonacci)
   - Understanding recursion depth and stack overflow

7. **Hashing**
   - Hash maps and sets
   - Applications (counting frequency, finding pairs)
